This project contains a collection of 16 different games developed entirely in the C++ programming language. The main goal of this project is to showcase a variety of gaming concepts and programming techniques through these small but fun games. Each game has its own unique gameplay and mechanics, providing a diverse experience for users. The games range from puzzles to action and strategy-based genres, demonstrating the versatility of C++ for game development.

The project uses standard C++ along with any additional libraries required for input handling and graphics, which are clearly mentioned in the documentation. Instructions on how to set up the development environment and compile the games on multiple platforms such as Windows, Linux, and macOS are provided to make it easy for users to run them. Each game can be launched individually, with details on controls and gameplay included for a better user experience.

Visual screenshots and animations are included in the documentation to give users a preview of what each game looks like in action. Additionally, this repository welcomes contributions from other developers who want to improve the current games or add new ones to the collection. The entire codebase is released under a clear license to ensure open collaboration and reuse under specified terms.

Known limitations and future enhancements are also documented to provide transparency and set expectations for ongoing development. Acknowledgements are given to any tutorials or resources that helped in the creation of the games. Overall, this project aims to be an educational and enjoyable resource for anyone interested in C++ game development.
